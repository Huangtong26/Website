          <p>This manga is by far my favorite and is really what got me into anime, manga, and manhwas.
          The story follows Sakuta Azusagawa, who one day finds fellow high-school student Mai Sakurajima wandering through the school library in a bunny girl outfit. Mai is surprised to find that Sakuta can see her, as she explains that currently no one else seems to be able to see or hear her, no matter what she does. Sakuta quickly realises that Mai must be suffering from a phenomenon called “Adolescence Syndrome”, which our protagonist is familiar with, thanks to his little sister going through it. Not wanting to see Mai suffer, Sakuta offers to stay by her side and help get to the bottom of the problem shes facing, an invitation she reluctantly accepts. Can Sakuta return Mais life to normal or is she destined to only be noticed by him forevermore? </p>
